# ReactJS app for blog post

This repository is used as a demo for a blog post on how to use Docker to clone a frontend app, build it and serve as a docker compose service.

The other repository is: https://github.com/gabrielgamilblog/django-demo-app-docker-front

##Audience

Backend developers who run their backend app and need to use the frontend for debugging and testing.
Basically the backend dev doesn't want to run the frontend app in dev mode. Simple build it and serve as a static SPA.
